# Clean coding

Any programming has some structure predefined,We can use that structure and flow to create our code structure or we can create our own flow.      
How ever the structure is if we follow certain rules and make good decisions at coding time itself,we can create clean and maitainable code.       
Which would reduce lot of debugging time.       

## Rules
1. When we want to use multiple lines(5+) of same code block at different places,create a method/function for it.
2. Give methods a name that defines it's usage,And call the method when needed.     
3. **Refractoring** Changing the structure of the code with out changing it's behaviour,this is done on existing code.
4. In refractoring we do two main things,search for related code,statements that are dependent on other statements
5. Repetitions,code structure, data flow that is repeated with slight modifications.We take all these and refactor it. 
6. Write a working logic first then create a method/class as needed with descriptive name and parameteres.
7.
